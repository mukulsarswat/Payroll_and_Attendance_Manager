```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Database Configuration

Create a MySQL database and configure the connection in the `.env` file. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update it with your database credentials:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=managepayrollattendance

# JWT Configuration
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
```

### 4. Migrate the Database

```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 5. Start the Application

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Testing the API

To test the API, follow these steps:

1. Open the `./testing/test.http` file in VSCode.
2. Install the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) in VSCode if you havenâ€™t already.
3. Click on the `Send Request` button next to each API request in the `test.http` file to test the corresponding endpoints.

### Endpoints

The API includes endpoints for managing employees, attendance, and payroll. You can find the full list of available routes in the `routes` directory.

### 7. Environment Variables

- `DB_HOST`: Hostname for your MySQL database.
- `DB_USER`: Your MySQL username.
- `DB_PASS`: Your MySQL password.
- `DB_NAME`: The database name.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: Secret for generating JWT access tokens.
